# DSCI 100 Project

Things to notice:
- did not include units of numerical variables (if not included in the dataset, either assume a unit that you think makes sense or mention it in the proposal/project)


in general: describe in written English the methods you used to perform your analysis from beginning to end that narrates the code the does the analysis.
Other things needed to be done besides Introduction, Discussion, Reference:

- need somebody to write down explanations of which code is doing what (there is no need for some really simple codes, but some explanations are definitely needed for some very important parts) & some results we obtained from our code (e.g. why we choose to fix majoraxislength, etc)

- what is our explanatory analysis doing.

- which method are we using(classification), cross-validation, and etc... need to insert explanation in the coding part.





- need somebody to finalize the format after everyone is done and submit it
